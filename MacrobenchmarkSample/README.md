# Macrobenchmark Sample

This sample project shows how to use the Jetpack Macrobenchmark library.

See the [Macrobenchmark guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/profile/macrobenchmark-intro) for more information on the library.

### Samples

The sample project includes the following:

* [TrivialStartupBenchmark](macrobenchmark/src/main/java/com/example/macrobenchmark/TrivialStartupBenchmark.kt) measures the application startup time for a trivial `Activity` with a single `TextView`.

* [SmallListStartupBenchmark](macrobenchmark/src/main/java/com/example/macrobenchmark/SmallListStartupBenchmark.kt) measures the application startup time for an `Activity` with a `RecyclerView` and an `Activity` with a Compose `LazyColumn`.

* [FrameTimingBenchmark](macrobenchmark/src/main/java/com/example/macrobenchmark/FrameTimingBenchmark.kt) scrolls a simple `RecyclerView` and Compose `LazyColumn`, measuring frame timing / jank.

### Running

Open the `MacrobenchmarkSample` project in Android Studio Bumblebee or later, and run benchmarks as you usually would run tests: Ctrl-Shift-F10 (Mac: Ctrl-Shift-R)

Alternatively, run the benchmarks from terminal with: 
```
./gradlew macrobenchmark:cC
```

### Reporting Issues
