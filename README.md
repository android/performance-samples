## [BenchmarkSample](BenchmarkSample)

This sample shows how to use the Benchmark library to benchmark code and UI from
library modules.

## [BenchmarkNdkSample (Prototype!)](BenchmarkNdkSample)

This prototype sample shows how to use the Benchmark library together with the
NDK, and [google/benchmark](https://github.com/google/benchmark) to benchmark
C++ code, while getting the Android-specific performance stability, and Studio
integration from the Jetpack Benchmark library.
